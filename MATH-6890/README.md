# RveesPersonalRepo
This repository is created to code and store/document all of my new ideas
I would like to keep track of all the code/documents/reports I wrote for my projects and courses in this repo

## Fall2021
This has two folders constaining all the projects that I worked on as a part of my courses.
### Finite Element Methods - Fokker Planck Equation solver
This folder contains both the 1D, 2D FPE solver codes and the final project report.

### Numerical Design Optimization
This folder has 4 projects in it and their corresponding reports.
Project 1 - Shape optimization of Heat Exchanger
Project 2 - Design of Aircraft's strut, to balance deterministic load.
Project 3 - Design optimization of a ride with stochastic ODE constraints
Project 4 - Design of Aircraft's strut with stochastic load. 

## Spring2022
Contains the course Problem Sets of Numerical Solutions to PDE. Details of each Problem set 
is in its respective sub-folders.
